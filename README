postinstall-debian-vm
=====================

Quick and dirty script to automate configuration and installation of additional
packages on fresh-installed Debian virtual machines.

Software installed:
* build environment (packages build-essential, cmake)
* ssh server (package openssh-server)
* open-vm-tools (packages open-vm-tools, open-vm-source) (VMWare) OR
* virtualbox-guest-utils (packages virtualbox-guest-utils, virtualbox-guest-dkms, virtualbox-guest-source)
* http tools (packages links2, curl)
* htop

Configuration changes:
* /etc/network/interfaces
    The file is overwritten, and config created for interfaces eth0 and lo.
    Static IP is configured for eth0, you will be prompted for an IP to be used
    as the eth0 address, in the form 192.168.1.xxx. Gateway will be set to
    192.168.1.1.

* /etc/resolv.conf
    Some public DNS servers will be added to resolv.conf (see source).

* /etc/apt/sources.list
    Repository "http://ftp.es.debian.org/debian/ squeeze main contrib" will be
    added (if it is not already found of sources.list), followed by and 
    "apt-get update".
